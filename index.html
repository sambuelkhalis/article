        <!-- What Is Programming? -->
        <p>Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages.</p>
        <p>
          The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient
          programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be
          considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering
          combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts, and programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problems. For this purpose, algorithms are
          classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of
          well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.

        <!-- Machine Language -->
        <h3>Machine Language</h3>
        <p>
          Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text
          format (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, two
          machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.
        </p>

        <!-- Compiler Language -->
        <h3>Compiler Language</h3>
        <p>
          High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[12] by Grace Hopper,
          who also coined the term 'compiler'.[13][14] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[15] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at
          commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.
        </p>
        <p>
          These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target for varying machine instruction sets via compilation
          declarations and heuristics. Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming easier[15] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation.

        <!-- Source Code Entry -->
        <h3>Source Code Entry</h3>
        <p>
          Programs were mostly entered using punched cards or paper tape. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text
          editors were also developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards.

        <h3>Bugs</h3>
        <p>
          In computer technology, a bug is a coding error in a computer program. (We consider a program to also include the microcode that is manufactured into a microprocessor.) The process of finding bugs -- before users do -- is called
          debugging. Debugging starts after the code is written and continues in stages as code is combined with other units of programming to form a software product, such as an operating system or an application.
        </p>
        <p>Bugs are often discovered after a product is released or during public beta testing. When this occurs, users have to find a way to avoid using the buggy code or get a patch from the software developers.</p>
        <p>
          A bug is just one kind of problem that a program can have. Programs can run bug-free and still be difficult to use or fail in some major objective. This kind of flaw is more difficult to test for. A well-designed program developed
          using a well-controlled process results in fewer bugs per thousands of lines of code. This is why it is important to include usability in testing.

        <h3>Debugging</h3>
        <p>
          Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as ‘bugs’) in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. To prevent incorrect operation of a software or
          system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects. When various subsystems or modules are tightly coupled, debugging becomes harder as any change in one module may cause more bugs to appear in another. Sometimes it
          takes more time to debug a program than to code it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Debugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their
          specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a static code analysis tool can help detect some possible problems. Normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce
          the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          To debug a program, user has to start with a problem, isolate the source code of the problem, and then fix it. A user of a program must know how to fix the problem as knowledge about problem analysis is expected. When the bug is
          fixed, then the software is ready to use. Debugging tools (called debuggers) are used to identify coding errors at various development stages. They are used to reproduce the conditions in which error has occurred, then examine the
          program state at that time and locate the cause. Programmers can trace the program execution step-by-step by evaluating the value of variables and stop the execution wherever required to get the value of variables or reset the
          program variables. Some programming language packages provide a debugger for checking the code for errors while it is being written at run time.

          <li>Reproduce The Problem</li>
          <li>Describe The Bug</li>
          <li>Capture The Program Snapshot When The Bug Appears</li>
          <li>Analyse The Snapshot Based On The State And Action</li>
          <li>Fix The Existing Bug</li>

          Welcome to my Article Website. First please let me introduce myself, my name Sambu El Khalis. I was born on November 26, 2005 in Jakarta, and I am now 16 years old, the first child in my family. I live in the city of Jakarta and
          attend SMK Pusaka 1 Jakarta 1st grade high school. My hobby is playing games and also I really like watching movies.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I grow up, I want to work as a freelancer with the skills I already have. and the reason why I chose to become a freelancer is because being a freelancer we have an office in our own room without the need to go to work, and
          also of course we don't need to meet clients to determine what projects will be made later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only is being a freelancer the job I want when I grow up, I also want to be a game developer. by becoming a game developer I can make games with the idea in my head, of course I want to make someone feel very different from
          other games if they play Games made by myself.
